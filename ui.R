Unique to this workm the  model also underwent formal review processes from both EMA and FDA, with input from both agencies during its development cycle."),

The model allowed for simultaneous fitting of summary and patient level data, allowing for integration of all information available. A further advantage of the BR model was that it constrained values to the range of the original instrument for simulation purposes, in contrast to methodologies that provide appropriate constraints only for conditional expectations. Treatment effects for currently available acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors, longitudinal changes in disease severity, dropout rate, placebo effect, and factors influencing these parameters were estimated in the model."),

Baseline ADAS-cog was estimated from baseline MMSE score. Disease progression was dependent on time, APOe4 status, age, and gender. Study drop out was a function of time, baseline age, and baseline MMSE. The use of the BR constrained simulations to the 0-70 range of the ADAS-cog, even when residuals were incorporated. The model underwent formal evaluation for suitability of use by both the FDA and EMA, and was deemed suitable for use by both agencies.
